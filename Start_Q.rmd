```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```
Import trainging data

```{r}
lafdtraining <- read.csv("C:/Users/Auser/Downloads/lafdtraining.csv")
testing <- read.csv("C:/Users/Auser/Desktop/R/testing.without.response.csv")

#As the values at fifth column are identical for all data, we just remove it.
lafdtraining=lafdtraining[,-c(5)]
testing=testing[,-c(5)]

dim(lafdtraining) #2774370 observations
training.nona=na.omit(lafdtraining)
dim(training.nona)#2315060 observations
length(na.omit(lafdtraining$elapsed_time))#2317430 observations
```
Most of NAs occur in the response variable, so I remove all observations with any NA.

training.nona is the training data without NA.

Now I do a check for testing data
```{r}
dim(testing) #530352 observations
dim(na.omit(testing)) #529836 observations
```
There are NAs in some observatons of testing data.for the column "Dispatch.Sequence" and  We probably need to take care of them later.

```{r}
summary(training.nona)
```
